> This is pretty much tailor-made (e.g. hard-coded library section ID) script right now that does one-way sync from Apple Music to Plex, though there are plans to make it work the other way around. If you’re lucky (or ask nicely via issues) it’ll be made more user-friendly, otherwise fix the code to work for your setup and (I’ll say it again) use it _at your own risk_.
